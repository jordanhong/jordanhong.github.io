I am a third year undergraduate student in the Engineering Science program at the University of Toronto, Canada. I will major in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Option starting September 2020.

My interest spans across electronics, photonics, and physics. Currently, I am a FPGA engineer intern at the Max Planck Institute of Microstructure Physics, department of Nanophotonics, Integration, and Neural Technology (NINT). I design FPGA systems to complement the PIC (photonic integrated circuits) for high performance computing and silicon-photonic MZI switch control.
